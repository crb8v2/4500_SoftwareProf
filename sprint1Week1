WEEK 3/4:

NOTES from the Teacher:
	Please estimate story points (1pt = 1 day) for your tasks 
	that you designed from last class. Then build a Sprint Backlog
	of tasks your team will work on for the remainder of the Sprint.

	I am going to record for each group the total number of committed
	story points.  Then compare that to the end of Sprint, the Sprint Review.  


NOTES:
